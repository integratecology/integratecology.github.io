I'm an academic generalist whose research generally centers on how weather and climate influence animal ecology. At the moment, I focus mostly on issues related to climate change, but I also have projects ongoing related to physiology, macroecology, invasion ecology, movement ecology, habitat selection, and applied conservation work. My dissertation work in the Goheen lab at the University of Wyoming centered on the energetic drivers of behavior and body size in bats, and my postdoctoral research at the Center for Advanced Systems Understanding centers on macroecological patterns of animal movement.

Aside from my ecological research, I am also working to increase access to science through open access, open science, and media. All too often, important scientific developments are hidden behind paywalls that moderate their impact and prevent communities that can't or shouldn't pay (e.g., high school students, the general public, local governments, researchers living outside of North America and western Europe) from engaging with those papers. Even among scientists, it’s often difficult to replicate science. The scientific community is rapidly developing promising new tools to overcome these problems, but we must continue to make progress. You can read my paper on how open access publication benefits conservation here. I’ve also written popular media articles on environmental and policy issues, publishing in outlets including FiveThirtyEight, High Country News, and Backcountry Journal.  

When I'm not science-ing, I'm usually reading, writing, or exploring nature with my wife, dogs, and fly rod.
